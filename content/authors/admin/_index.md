I am currently a DPhil (PhD) student at University of Oxford, [AIMS CDT](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk), advised by [Prof A. Vedaldi](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/), [Dr C. Rupprecht](https://chrirupp.github.io), and [Dr I. Laina](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=n9nXAPcAAAAJ&hl=en) at [VGG](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/).
I am broadly interested in unsupervised scene understanding, with emphasis on objects.

In previous life, I worked as MLE for OakNorth and Bloomberg. I graduated with MEng in Computer Science from University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof Li√≤](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/). 
Feel free to explore further. Apologies, this site is still under construction.
