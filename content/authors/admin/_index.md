I am currently a Machine Learning Enginner at [OakNorth](https://www.oaknorth.com) working on various computer vision models. 
Before that I worked for [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/product/asset-and-investment-manager/) where I used market transaction data to better model users and their needs.

I graduated with MEng from University of Cambridge. My supervisor was the amazing [Prof Li√≤](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/). During my time here, I was associated with [Fizwilliam College](https://www.fitz.cam.ac.uk) and my DoS was [Dr Harle](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rkh23/site/). 

Feel free to explore further. Apologies, this site is still under construction.
